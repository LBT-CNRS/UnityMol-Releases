/*
 * Localizable.strings
 *
 * Guidelines:
 *
 * 1/ Write keys as CamelCase. In the code, this will be prefixed with kStr: kStrThisIsAKey.
 *
 * 2/ For descriptions, use 100-column limit and align multiple lines on the first character.
 *    For strings, do not break lines.
 *
 * 3/ Write a meaningful description, so the translator can know what exactly you are talking about.
 *
 * 4/ Without context, a single word is hard to translate. For instance, the word "search" can be a
 *    noun or a verb and they have different translations in other languages. Add the grammar
 *    class, the verb tense or any other information to distinguish between homonyms.
 *
 * 5/ Supply the maximum number of characters for strings in the comment. For example:
 *   /# Button label which starts warp (i.e. faster than light travel) mode. (30 chars) #/
 *   "WarpModeButtonLabel" = "Warp Speed";
 *
 * 6/ For accessibility items, include "ACCESSIBILITY" in the key and comments. Generally
 *    accessibility strings do not have a limit, because they are spoken. Indicate this with (no
 *    limit).
