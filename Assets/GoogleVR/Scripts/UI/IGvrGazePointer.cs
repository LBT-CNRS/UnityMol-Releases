/// itself to the **GazeInputModule.gazePointer** static member variable.
/// A registered instance should also un-register itself at 'OnDisable' calls
/// by setting the **GazeInputModule.gazePointer** static member variable
/// to null.
///

/// looking at objects in the scene by the movement of their head. For example,
/// see the GvrReticle class.
