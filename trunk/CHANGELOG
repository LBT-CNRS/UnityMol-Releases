Please refer to the UnityMol SVN repositories for
change details prior to the 0.9.1 release.


Changes in version 0.9.2 (this release) (2013-04-16).
-----------------------------------------------------

Modifications:
- The asset folder "Standard Assets/Image Effects (Pro Only)" was moved
  to the "Resources" subfolder.
- The Dream Image effect dependencies were renamed so that they do not
  conflict with the standard Image Effects of the Pro version. This old
  image effect does not yet work, though.


Changes in version 0.9.1 (2013-04-9). 
-------------------------------------

License change: UnityMol is now distributed under the CeCILL-C license,
which is an adaptation of the LGPL to French law.

New features:
- Shortcut button to activate HyperBalls smooth link representation.

Improvements:
- The majority of warnings could be corrected by cleaning unused
  portions of the code and removing obsolete variables.

Bug fixes:
- There are no bugs in UnityMol :) .. ok, I'm kidding. WiP.

Additions:
- This ChangeLog was initiated.
- New color schemes were added.

Changes:
- The whole filetree was cleaned up and reorganized. Old and duplicate
  files were removed.
